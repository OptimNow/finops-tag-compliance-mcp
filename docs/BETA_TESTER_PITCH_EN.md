Subject: Beta testing an MCP for AWS FinOps - need your input

Hey [Name],

I've built an MCP server for AWS tagging compliance and I'm looking for 2-3 trusted people to test it before I launch commercially.

Quick context: It's an MCP that integrates with Claude to audit AWS tagging. Finds non-compliant resources, calculates the cost impact, suggests fixes. Phase 1 is done, internal tests look good, now I need external validation.

What I'm asking: 5-10 hours of testing over 30-60 days. Structured feedback (bugs, suggestions, use cases). Simple gentleman's agreement on confidentiality (just an email confirmation).

What you get: Early access to an innovative FinOps tool. Direct influence on the roadmap. 50% lifetime discount if you become a customer. Potential resell/co-sell partnership opportunities for freelancers and consultants.

Interested? I'll send more details and the agreement.

Let me know,

Subject: Beta Testing Invitation - MCP Server for AWS FinOps

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I know you work with FinOps/DevOps challenges, and I've built something that might interest you.

I created an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that solves a problem I kept running into: AWS tagging compliance and cloud cost attribution.

Here's the thing. According to the FinOps Foundation, 43% of cloud costs aren't properly attributed because of missing or incorrect tags. Compliance audits take 2-3 days per month. Existing tools like CloudHealth are heavy and expensive. And none of them integrate with modern AI assistants like Claude.

So I built an MCP server that integrates natively with Claude Desktop. Run a compliance audit in seconds instead of days. Automatically calculate your "cost attribution gap" (the $ you can't allocate). Get intelligent tag suggestions powered by ML. Bulk tag resources with approval workflows. Right now it's AWS-focused (Azure and GCP planned for Phase 2).

Phase 1 MVP is complete and functional. I've tested it internally for two months and it works well. Now I need external validation before commercializing.

I'm looking for 3-5 beta testers with FinOps, DevOps, or Cloud Architect backgrounds. You'd deploy the server in an AWS test environment, test the features for 30-60 days, and provide structured feedback. We're talking 5-10 hours total, spread out over that period.

Requirements are pretty straightforward. You need access to an AWS account (sandbox or dev, not production) with 50-100 resources minimum (a few hundred would be ideal). Basic Docker and server deployment skills. Understanding of FinOps concepts and tagging. And you'd need to confirm a simple gentleman's agreement on confidentiality since the source code is still private.

What's in it for you? You get early access to the first MCP of its kind for FinOps. Direct influence on the product roadmap. A 50% lifetime discount if you become a paying customer (worth €300-600/month). For freelancers and consultants, potential resell or co-sell partnership opportunities. And optionally, recognition as a beta tester if you want it.

If you're interested, here's how it works. Reply to this email and I'll send you the confidentiality agreement and full documentation. Once that's signed, you get access to the private GitHub repo. We can do a 30-minute kickoff call so you're set up and autonomous.

Any questions, just ask.

Thanks for considering,
Jean

## One-Page Overview

### The Problem

Almost half of cloud costs can't be properly attributed. That's according to the FinOps Foundation's 2025 report. The culprit? Missing or incorrect tags on AWS resources.

Compliance audits are manual and time-consuming. Two to three days per month, on average. Existing tools like CloudHealth and CloudCheckr are heavy and expensive. And none of them integrate with modern AI assistants.

The result? Millions in unattributable cloud spend. No way to optimize effectively. Frustrated FinOps teams.

### The Solution

I built the first MCP server dedicated to tagging compliance and FinOps optimization. It does a few key things really well.

Run compliance audits in seconds instead of days. Calculate your cost attribution gap automatically (the dollars you can't allocate). Get intelligent tag suggestions powered by machine learning. Apply bulk tagging with built-in approval workflows. It integrates natively with Claude Desktop. Supports 50+ AWS resource types.

How is it different? Compared to CloudHealth or CloudCheckr, it's simpler, cheaper, and AI-integrated. Compared to AWS native tools, it validates schemas, calculates cost impact, and provides suggestions. Compared to custom scripts, it's a packaged solution that's maintained and evolves.

### Current Status

Phase 1 MVP is complete as of January 2025. The MCP server runs on AWS EC2. It supports 50+ resource types. Full documentation is ready (technical and user guides). Internal tests are validated.

Next step is external validation with beta testers. Then commercial launch in Q1 2025, AWS Marketplace in Q2, multi-cloud support (Azure and GCP) in Q3.

### Beta Testing Program

I'm looking for 3-5 trusted testers. Ideal profile? Someone with 2+ years of FinOps, DevOps, or Cloud Architecture experience. AWS skills (IAM, EC2, tagging). Ability to provide structured feedback. Availability for 5-10 hours over 30-60 days.

What's required? You'd confirm a simple gentleman's agreement on confidentiality (the source code is still private). Deploy and test in your AWS environment with 50-100 resources minimum (a few hundred would be ideal). Provide a structured test report using a template I'll give you.

What do you get? Early adopter access to the first FinOps MCP on the market. Direct influence on the roadmap. A 50% lifetime discount if you become a customer (worth €300-600/month). For freelancers and consultants, potential resell or co-sell partnership opportunities. Optional recognition as a beta tester.

### Timeline

Week 1: Initial contact and confidentiality agreement signed. Week 2: Onboarding, access to repo, deployment, support available. Weeks 3-6: Functional testing and continuous feedback. Week 7: Final report and cleanup (destroy all copies).

Start date is mid-January 2025. End date is mid-March 2025.

### Common Questions

Is testing free? Yes, completely. No credit card needed. Only commitment is your time (5-10 hours) and a simple gentleman's agreement on confidentiality.

Do I need a big AWS account? Between 50 and 100 resources in total are enough to properly test the features. If you can manage to find an AWS account with a few hundred resources, that would be even better for comprehensive testing, but it's not required.

What about security? We've taken extra care with security from day one. The server scans your resources but doesn't store anything externally - everything stays in your AWS environment. You can find detailed documentation about our security posture and all the security tests we've conducted in the docs folder. We take security seriously, especially for a FinOps tool that accesses cloud infrastructure.

I don't have much time, can I still participate? I'd prefer someone who's committed. But if you're really interested and tight on time, let me know and we can adapt.

Can I become a customer after? Yes, absolutely. But it's more than that. If you're a freelancer or consultant, you could become a partner with resell or co-sell agreements. We're open to building strategic partnerships with people who see the value in the product.

Will the code be open source? Right now, no. There's significant effort and know-how embedded in this tool, so we're keeping it under a proprietary license. We need to focus on building a sustainable business model first. We might consider an Open Core model later based on market feedback, but for now the priority is on licensing. Your feedback on this approach is welcome though.

## Handling Common Objections

### "I don't have time"

I get it. For context, deployment takes about 30 minutes, then you can test at your own pace (even 1 hour per week works). But if time is really tight, no worries. Maybe next round?

### "My company won't let me sign a personal confidentiality agreement"

No problem. Your company can sign instead if you prefer. Or we can adapt the agreement if you're testing as an independent consultant. The important thing is protecting the code.

### "I can't use my work AWS account"

That's totally normal and actually recommended. You can create a free AWS account (free tier) just for testing. Or use your company's AWS sandbox if available. I can even provide access to a test AWS account if you're really stuck.

### "How do I know it works?"

I've been testing internally for two months and it runs well. But that's exactly why I need beta testing - to validate with real AWS environments different from mine. If you find bugs, that's perfect. I'll fix them. There's no production guarantee at this stage (it's an MVP).

### "I'd rather wait for the commercial version"

Totally understandable. Just note that beta testers get 50% off for life (versus 0% later), direct influence on the product (roadmap and features), and early access.

But if you prefer to wait, I'll contact you at launch (planned for March 2025). Want me to add you to the list?

### "What's an MCP server?"

Great question. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol created by Anthropic to connect Claude and other AI to external tools.

Basically: You chat with Claude in Claude Desktop. Claude calls my MCP server to scan your AWS resources. Claude presents the results in natural language. You can ask Claude to fix the issues.

It's like giving Claude FinOps superpowers.

### "Why not use an official AWS plugin?"

Good question. Official AWS MCPs (if they exist) just read tags. My MCP goes further: validates against a custom tagging policy schema, calculates the cost of mistagged resources, provides intelligent tag suggestions (ML), enables bulk tagging with approval workflows.

It's more of a specialized FinOps tool than a simple AWS tag reader.
