# Archive

This directory contains historical files that are no longer needed for active development but are preserved for reference.

## Structure

- **development/** - Temporary debug scripts and test files used during development
- **specs/** - Completed phase specifications and planning documents
  - PHASE-1-SPECIFICATION.md (Phase 1 complete)
  - SPECIFICATION.md (superseded by phase-specific docs)
  - REFACTORING_PLAN.md (Phase 1.9 planning document)

## Files Moved to Other Locations

The following files were reorganized during archival:
- **Business/Legal docs** → `docs/business/` (beta testing, NDAs, monetization)
- **UAT documents** → `docs/UAT/` (UAT protocols, testing overviews)
- **Development journal** → `docs/DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md`
- **Project management** → `.kiro/` (restored to root)

## Why These Files Were Archived

These files served their purpose during the initial development and planning phases but are no longer actively referenced in the codebase. They are preserved here for historical context and future reference.

**Date Archived**: 2026-02-04
